# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis

Dana would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We will get this done by updating the HTML file and app.js

## Filtering

Visit UFO Finder

## Summary

This is an ecellent tool for reseraching UFO sightings. The one drawback I see is that there is only one year represented. Unless your just interested in the day or month this is a big miss. On top of that I would move the ability to reset the filters off of "UFO Sightings" and make it its own link near the filters. I would also add an additional filter for Duration.
